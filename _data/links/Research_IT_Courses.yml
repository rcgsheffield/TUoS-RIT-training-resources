- title: "RIT-211: Parallel Computing with Matlab"
  description: "This course is split into two units, each unit taking an average of three hours of presentations and practice. Attenders must have basic MATLAB knowledge to be able to take advantage of this course. The first session will cover fundamentals of parallel MATLAB and the training exercises will be performed on the users' local Windows workstations. The second session will introduce using MATLAB on a Linux-based HPC cluster and the exercises will be performed on the Sheffield University HPC cluster named 'sharc' using the Distributed Compute Engine. Participants must register to use 'sharc' before attending the course."

- title: "RIT-301: Introduction to Python Programming"
  description: "Python is a widely used open source, high-level programming language. The design philosophy of the Python language provides code readability. The syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than possible in low-level languages such as C/C++, Fortran or Java. This course provides a general introduction to the basic concepts of the Python programming language. This course is an ideal choice for people who starting to learn programming. Course content: Variables, Loops, Conditional statement, Lists. "
